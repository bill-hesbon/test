            <h2>Who we are</h2>
            <p>Our website address is: https://cutone.org.</p>
            <p>
              LC Associates is an energy consulting company that provides a full
              range of energy services including:
            </p>
            <ol>
              <li>Energy Consulting and Advisory Services</li>
              <li>Strategic Energy Procurement Services</li>
              <li>Energy Incentives and Rebates Consulting</li>
              <li>Demand Response Services</li>
            </ol>
            <h2>What is Green Connect Entrepreneur Portal?</h2>
            <p>
              It is a software developed by LC Associates to uncover deep energy
              savings. It was developed for the reason that human eyes, and
              expert minds, typically cannot observe Deep Energy Savings without
              data visualization. It allows electric utility Clients to monitor
              energy KPI's and act on them. GreenConnect will aide in the
              identification of hidden inefficiencies so energy professionals
              can offer solutions to reduce energy costs or generate revenue.
            </p>
            <h2>What personal data we collect and why we collect it</h2>
            <p>
              The Customer Data Privacy Policy was initiated for the benefit of
              our customers, to ensure the protection of customer-specific
              energy use data and personally identifiable information (PII). The
              goal is to strike a reasonable balance between the collection, use
              or disclosure of any customer information by LC Associates while
              facilitating safe and reliable energy service, complying with
              legislative and regulatory mandates and meeting customers’
              expectations regarding the collection, disclosure and use of their
              data and personal information.
            </p>
            <p>
              LC Associates’ privacy policy is reviewed on a periodic basis.
              When an update is made, a notice of LC Associate’s privacy policy
              will be prominently posted on the www.cutone.org website.
            </p>
